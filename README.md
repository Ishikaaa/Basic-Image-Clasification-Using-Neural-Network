# Basic-Image-Clasification-Using-Neural-Network

In this course, I focused on three learning objectives:

1. Learn to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Understand the basics of neural networks.
3. Learn to solve classification problems with the help of neural networks.

By the end of this course, I was able to create a neural network model which is able to classify images of hand written digits with a high degree of accuracy.
